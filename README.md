## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

During the course of this challenge, i learnt a lot of things. Some of them are:

- how to center an element and an image properly
- how to use media queries (still learning that though)
- how to use JavaScript for interactivity. I wrote my first web JavaScript in this challenge

### Continued development

I wish to understand more of media queries and responsiveness. I'm also learning JavaScript now and I'll tackle challenges involving the language.
CSS is not a comfortable zone yet but I'm working on that.


## Acknowledgments

Thanks to Frontend mentor for this challenge. Kudos to freeCodeCamp and W3Schools... they helped me sort out a lot of things.
Thanks to Marijn Haverbeke book, Eloquent JavaScript. Made me understand some obscure things in the little JavaScript knowledge i possess now.
And thanks to everyone that will check out and give constructive criticisms on this code.
